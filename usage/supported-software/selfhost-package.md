## selfhost

**About**

`selfhost` is a flexible set of tools used to automate hosting web applications on your own server with minimal effort. `selfhost` packages ngnix web server wich can be accessed via Tor (default, `selfhost-onion`) or via clearnet using Certbot (`selfhost-clearnet`).

**Usage**
* Each installed app that supports `selfhost` integrates with it out of the box.
* Tor onion domain is generated by default.
  * Your hostname can be found at `/var/lib/tor/selfhost_hidden_service/hostname`
* Install `selfhost-clearnet` to activate clearnet domain **continue reading the docs!**
* Installation of `selfhost-clearnet` **requires interaction** because it asks for domain.
* **You must have a working domain pointing to your node for `selfhost-clearnet` to work!**
* `selfhost-clearnet-certbot` is installed by default and **needs a working e-mail address** for receiving **important security notifications**!
* `selfhost-clearnet-certbot` will create a TLS certificate for you so that HTTPS works.
* It's recommended to also install `selfhost-dashboard`. This will be automatic in the future.
