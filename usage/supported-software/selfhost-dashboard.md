# Selfhost Dashboard

## selfhost-dashboard

### **About**

`selfhost-dashboard` is a very simple, nice UI providing SSO and easy access to all installed selfhost applications.

### **Usage**

* **Go to /dashboard and set a strong password immediately after installation!!!**
* Run `sudo /usr/share/selfhost/lib/get_default_domain.sh` to get the address.
* After setting the password/logging in you should see all installed apps and be able to open them with a single click.
* BTCPayServer and Transmuter don't support SSO at this time - you still need to setup your own password.
