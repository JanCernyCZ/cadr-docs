# NBXplorer

## nbxplorer

### **About**

A minimalist UTXO tracker for HD Wallets. Used primarily with BTCPayServer.

### **Usage**

You probably don't want to use `nbxplorer` directly but install BTCPayServer. If you need to use it directly, you can find the port in `/etc/nbxplorer-mainnet/nbxplorer.conf` and the cookie in `/var/lib/nbxplorer-mainnet/Main/.cookie`.
