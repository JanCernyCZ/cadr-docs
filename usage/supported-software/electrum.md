### **About**

Electrum is a powerful Bitcoin wallet that has many interesting features, the most important being ability to use hardware wallets. It needs a server to fetch data from. The server \(`electrs`\) is provided in this repository.

### **Usage**

* **Important: you need to have `desktop` component active in order to install `electrum`**
* You shouldn't notice a huge difference from running ordinary Electrum
* The only noteworthy change to the official app is that launching it from menu will make sure it's only connected to your own local full node.
* Please keep in mind you'll need to wait for `electrs` to sync before you can use Electrum
