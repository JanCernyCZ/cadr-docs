{% hint style="danger" %}
**The project is still work in progress!** For the time-being a basic admin skills going to be of a great help. It is often faster and more illustrative to provide the code via commands that you paste to your terminal window, than writing the instruction for GUI.

Any feedback you might provide is appreciated. You can do so by [reaching out to us](community/support-1.md) or opening an issue on [GitHub repository](%20https://github.com/debian-cryptoanarchy/cryptoanarchy-deb-repo-builder/issues) page.
