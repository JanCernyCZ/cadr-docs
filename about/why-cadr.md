# Why CADR

## ðŸŽ¯ What's the point

If you use any operating system, there are many programs called "services" running in the background handling various tasks for you. Whether it's drivers, file indexers, music players... It's almost certain you don't even know what many of them do and how they got into the system. In general all OSes have their ways to get those important services to run on your computer. Debian uses its own "package manager" that can automatically figure out which services you need and install them for you based on what applications you use.

I believe that this is how Bitcoin software should behave too. You should not have to manually install and configure everything. While possible, educating and empowering, it comes with great costs:

* Not everyone has confidence or time to do that
* Security risks stemming from misconfiguration
* Security risks stemming from failure to verify the software properly \(tedious task that package managers can handle too\)
* It gets boring once you do it for a ~third time

It was not previously possible to install Bitcoin software as automatically as e.g. pulseaudio because nobody created the package files needed for it to work. This repository was made to address this issue and allow to install Bitcoin software stack automatically. 

We believe that this is the way Bitcoin related software should behave as well. Currently, the user is often referred to a GitHub repository, where in the described installation is tedious manual procedure prone to problems listed above.

{% hint style="success" %}
**One command will deploy secure, configured and verified stack of free, open Bitcoin tools enabling you to immediately start using it and achieve freedom.** 
{% endhint %}

Yes, installing any Bitcoin/freedom-related application is now going to be as easy as installing VLC. It'll be possible to use GUI or simple `apt` command.
