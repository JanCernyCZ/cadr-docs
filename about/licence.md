# Licence

**The exact license of this project is not decided/created yet.** I plan to make it as compatible with Voluntaryism as possible. It'll probably be very similar to GPL but without mandatory disclosure of source code. \(That means you can refrain from disclosing the source but you may not prevent other people from copying, inspecting and modifying the binary unless they agreed to not do it in written private contract.\) Modification, redistribution, and commercial use will be allowed.

For discussion, check [Licencing issue](https://github.com/debian-cryptoanarchy/cryptoanarchy-deb-repo-builder/issues/134).

In the meantime I hereby publicly declare that I will not seek to sue people using this project regarding copyright law unless they sue me or anyone else regarding the copyright law first. Especially, but not limited to the contributors to this project. To the best of my knowledge, this public declaration is legally binding for me as a Slovak citizen and I intend it to be. I specifically want any my attempts at suing to be void if unprovoked.

Moreover, feel free to publicly criticize me for doing anything incompatible with the philosophy of [Voluntaryism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvJiHSN1exU).

By contributing to this repository you agree with the general direction of licensing. If you have questions about this, don't hesitate to contact me.
